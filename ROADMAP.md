# KODER Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features, enhancements, and improvements for the KODER VS Code extension. It serves as a guide for future development efforts.

## Short-term Goals (1-3 months)

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Implement local LLM integration as an alternative to Azure OpenAI
- [ ] Add vector embeddings for more semantic code search
- [ ] Enhance indexing performance for large codebases
- [ ] Implement code change detection during indexing to avoid full re-indexing

### User Experience
- [ ] Create a welcome/onboarding experience for first-time users
- [ ] Improve the UI for AI responses (syntax highlighting, code actions)
- [ ] Add support for custom AI prompts and templates
- [ ] Implement history view for past conversations

### Terminal Integration
- [ ] Add automatic error detection in terminal output
- [ ] Improve terminal command suggestion system
- [ ] Add support for multi-line command execution

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
- [ ] Add code generation capabilities with multi-file context
- [ ] Implement custom fine-tuning for project-specific knowledge
- [ ] Add support for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- [ ] Create specialized modes for different tasks (debugging, testing, refactoring)

### Integration Improvements
- [ ] Add Git integration for analyzing commit history and changes
- [ ] Implement debugging integration for runtime context
- [ ] Add support for project-specific knowledge bases
- [ ] Integrate with popular issue trackers (GitHub, Jira, etc.)

### Performance & Scalability
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for very large codebases
- [ ] Implement selective indexing based on file relevance
- [ ] Add support for distributed indexing across machines
- [ ] Create a cloud-sync system for team knowledge sharing

## Long-term Goals (6+ months)

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement multi-agent systems for specialized tasks
- [ ] Add automatic code review capabilities
- [ ] Create a natural language query system for codebase exploration
- [ ] Develop "coding copilot" mode for real-time assistance

### Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Build an API for third-party extensions to leverage KODER's context
- [ ] Create integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous learning
- [ ] Implement team collaboration features for shared AI assistance
- [ ] Develop a knowledge exchange platform for cross-project insights

### Community & Open Source
- [ ] Create an open model for community-contributed prompts and templates
- [ ] Build a plugin system for extension capabilities
- [ ] Implement telemetry for community-based improvements (opt-in)
- [ ] Develop documentation and learning resources for extension users

## Technical Debt & Architecture

### Refactoring
- [ ] Move to a modular architecture for easier component replacement
- [ ] Refactor the memory system for better persistence options
- [ ] Create a proper abstraction layer for AI providers

### Testing & Quality
- [ ] Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests
- [ ] Add E2E testing for critical user flows
- [ ] Create proper performance benchmarks for indexing and search
- [ ] Implement telemetry for identifying performance bottlenecks

### Security & Privacy
- [ ] Enhance the auto-approval system for better security control
- [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data storage
- [ ] Create data isolation between projects
- [ ] Add granular permissions for AI actions

## Feedback and Contributions

This roadmap is a living document and will evolve based on user feedback and community contributions. If you have suggestions or want to contribute to any of these features, please:
